# Mini-Compiler
This project is a mini-compiler that implements the different stages of compilation, including lexical analysis using FLEX, syntax and semantic analysis using BISON, intermediate code generation, optimization, and object code generation. The compiler also handles symbol table management and error handling during the compilation process.
